# YHack2019-Medi
An Android mobile app to extract dosage info from medicine bottle and manage a list of personal medicines.

### Inspiration
The dosage information on medicine bottles are too small for the elderly to read. Also, a lot of people have too many medicines to find the needed one quickly. 

### What it does
Take a photo of dosage information on medicine bottles, convert it into bigger legible texts. Can also store the name and dosage info into your own personal database of medicines. 

### How I built it
Created and connected five activities using Android Studio. Query database using MySQL and python.

### Challenges I ran into
Spent much time trying to access to the camera and to use Google Cloud Firebase and Vision API in ML Kit. 

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Didn't give up when overwhelmed by bugs and new tools.
Asked Google Cloud mentors for help when needed.

### What I learned
Android Studio, Google Cloud Firebase ML Kit

### What's next for YHack2019-Medi
Access to the camera, integrate Google Firebase Vision API
